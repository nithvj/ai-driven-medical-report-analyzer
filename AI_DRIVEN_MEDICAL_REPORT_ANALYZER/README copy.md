# ðŸ©º Blood Report Analysis

## Overview

The Medical Report Analysis app is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze  reports from PDF files. Built using the Streamlit framework, this application processes the data extracted from the PDF and delivers a detailed analysis, which includes key medical findings, potential health concerns, recommended follow-up tests, actionable lifestyle advice, and references to trusted medical resources. The goal of this application is to provide users with insights into their health based on their blood test reports and to offer guidance on necessary steps for improving or maintaining their health.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload their blood test reports in PDF format, which the app will analyze.
- **Detailed Analysis:** The app leverages the CrewAI framework, involving specialized agents, to parse and analyze the report data, providing a comprehensive summary of the results.
- **Health Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, the app generates personalized health advice, including lifestyle modifications and suggested medical follow-ups.
- **Trusted Resources:** The app includes references to high-quality medical articles and resources, allowing users to further understand their health conditions.

## Application Workflow

1. **Data Extraction:** The app uses PyPDF2 to extract text data from the uploaded PDF files.
2. **Analysis:** Leveraging CrewAI, the app processes the data through various agents, each responsible for specific tasks such as summarizing key findings, identifying health concerns, and providing recommendations.
3. **Output:** The processed data is then displayed on the Streamlit interface, categorized into key findings, main health concerns, additional tests or follow-ups, lifestyle advice, and trusted medical resources.
