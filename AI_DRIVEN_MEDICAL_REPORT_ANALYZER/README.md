## Overview

The Medical Report Analysis app is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze medical reports from PDF files. Built using the Streamlit framework, this application processes the data extracted from the PDF and delivers a detailed analysis, which includes key medical findings, potential health concerns, recommended follow-up tests, actionable lifestyle advice, and references to trusted medical resources. The goal of this application is to provide users with insights into their health based on their test reports and to offer guidance on necessary steps for improving or maintaining their health.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload their  test reports in PDF format, which the app will analyze.
- **Detailed Analysis:** The app leverages the CrewAI framework, involving specialized agents, to parse and analyze the report data, providing a comprehensive summary of the results.
- **Health Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, the app generates personalized health advice, including lifestyle modifications and suggested medical follow-ups.
- **Trusted Resources:** The app includes references to high-quality medical articles and resources, allowing users to further understand their health conditions.
